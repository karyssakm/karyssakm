### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ’¬ I am a driven and innovative Software Engineer with a strong background in full-stack development, automation, and data management. My expertise spans technologies like Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js, which I've used to develop scalable and secure web applications. I have a proven ability to automate complex processes, significantly improving operational efficiency and driving business growth.

During my time as a Senior Product Analyst at Flywheel Digital, I led the development of automation tools that enhanced product information accuracy by 82%. My work with AWS-based automation initiatives contributed to over $3 million in additional revenue and a 150% year-over-year growth in profitability. I also served as a Technical Analyst, where I streamlined key processes by integrating Amazon APIs and managing a Scrum team.

In addition to my technical skills, Iâ€™ve successfully managed cross-functional teams, mentored over 160 new employees, and consistently delivered high-quality software solutions. My ability to solve complex technical problems and collaborate effectively has allowed me to thrive in every role, from product management to software engineering.
